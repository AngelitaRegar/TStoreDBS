# TStoreDBS
This is a project assignment for the Database Systems course that was carried out by me and my team. First, we analyze how the database system will be created, starting from determining the entities, attributes, and relationships. Then we describe it in the form of ERD using Visual Paradigm.
We then code the ERD using Microsoft SQL Server so that it becomes a database. We perform processes on the database such as filling in data (DML), simulating transactions (DML), and providing some queries that resulting important data.
